                Theres something mysterious– maybe even alchemical— about the qualities that have to come together to yield the ideal croissant. To fit the bill, it should 
                be buttery and tender, but never mushy or overly moist. It requires a delicate flakiness-to-chewiness ratio thats remarkably hard to achieve, and the layers 
                of all-butter puff pastry should be well differentiated, without falling apart into a crumby mess when you bite into them.

            Croissants are a style of viennoiserie pastries, which of course relates back to the Austrian city of Vienna, otherwise known as the birthplace of croissants.
            The ancestor to the modern-day croissant was called the kipferl, which dates back to the 13th century and comes in various shapes and sizes. They are often filled 
            with nuts or other fillings, and kipferl (which have possible but unconfirmed roots in ancient Egypt), are also considered to be a form of rugelach, a Jewish pastry
            of Ashkenazic origin. They are denser and sweeter to what we think of as the modern croissant.

            Legend has it, Viennese bakers working throughout the night.They alerted the citys defenders, 
            in essence saving it from the Ottoman siege. In celebration, the bakers created a pastry that would symbolize the crescent moon, which is also the prominent symbol on the 
            Turkish flag. The German word kipferl, or crescent, became a culinary re-enactment of Viennas victory over the Turks.
            The first verified evidence of the croissant in France is due to a baker named August Zang. Zang had an upscale patisserie in Paris in the early 1800s, named the 
            Boulangerie Viennoise after his native Vienna and serving many of their famous treats — including kipferl. His Parisian version, though, was made flakier than the
            traditional sweets, and Parisians began calling them croissants because of their crescent shapes.
